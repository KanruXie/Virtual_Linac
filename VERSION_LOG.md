# VERSIONS NOTE
(Version control and management were not done very well since working on full GUI. It's very different now from previous scripts, why not re-number the versions from v1.0.0)
***
### V1.0.0
GUI designed and packed with:
1. Main window
2. Input File Create window (almost fully functioned)
3. Output File Analyze window (a lot to improve)
4. New Beam Commissioning (a lot to improve)
5. Collimator Designing window (not started yet)
6. Instruction Manual (document created)
