# VERSIONS NOTE
(Version control and management were not done very well since working on full GUI. It's very different now from previous scripts, why not re-number the versions from v1.0.0)
***
### V1.1.0
1. Spatial distribution now support uniform distribution,
both on Beam Commissioning and Input file Creator.
   
2. All interpolated measured data are uploaded to Measured Data folder.
Associated calculations and graph plotting in Output file Analyzer have been 
   updated as well.
***
#### V1.0.1
Fixed the calculation mistake in X Jaws trcl card, where we need to use fs / 100 but not / 200. This 
is a mistake associated with the issue of how to define the Jaws position from input window. 
Field size calculations were fixed but this one here was forgotten.
***
## V1.0.0
GUI designed and packed with:
1. Main window
2. Input File Create window (almost fully functioned)
3. Output File Analyze window (a lot to improve)
4. New Beam Commissioning (a lot to improve)
5. Collimator Designing window (not started yet)
6. Instruction Manual (document created)
